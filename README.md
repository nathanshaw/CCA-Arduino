This repo houses code for creating interactive projects using an Arduino Microcontroller

This code base was created by Adjunct Professor Nathan Villicana-Shaw for the California College of the Arts IxD department but is free for use by anyone.

The sensors and actuators folders provides starter code for working with a variety of 
physical sensors and actuators.

The lessons folder contains code which explains important Physical Computer concepts such as button bounce and proper use of millis. 

The advanced folder contains boilerplate code for creating more advanced programs which use Processing, Python, and other Programming languages. It even covers some basic computer vision and machine learning using Open CV and the Wekinator.

Please feel free to create an issue if something is not working as expected for you.

Enjoy!
